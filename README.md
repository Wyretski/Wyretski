### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Wyretski/Wyretski** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## I'm Wyretski (the W and y are silent)!
## Please ignore my obsession with anthro animals, I think it's a result of childhood brain damage.
## I'm literate in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, and a small bit of Lua.
