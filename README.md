# 🐾 Hi, I'm Wyretski!
#### (The "W" and "y" are silent)
### - Please ignore my obsession with anthro animals, I think it's a result of childhood brain damage.
### - I have ~3 years of experience working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, & Lua.
### - I most like & am best at coding that involves organizing large lists & arrays of data.
#### A.K.A. Don't let me design a website or UI because it WILL be ugly, but functional.
