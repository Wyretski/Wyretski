# 🐾 Hi, I'm Wyretski!
#### (The "W" and "y" are silent)
### - Please ignore my obsession with anthro animals, I think it's a result of childhood brain damage.
### - I'm literate in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, and a small bit of Lua.
### - I like & am best at coding that involves organizing large lists & arrays of data.
#### A.K.A. Don't let me design a website or UI because it WILL be ugly, but functional
