# 🐾 Hi, I'm Wyretski!
#### (The "W" and "y" are silent)
### - Please ignore my obsession with anthro animals, I think it's a result of childhood brain damage.
### - I'm most familiar with Python, but I'm trying to become more literate in other languages.
### - I mostly code to make my homework easier, but I sometimes do actually cool and interesting stuff.
