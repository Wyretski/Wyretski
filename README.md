# 🐾 Hi, I'm Wyretski!
#### (The "W" and "y" are silent)
### - Please ignore my obsession with anthro animals, I think it's a result of childhood brain damage.
### - I have ~3 years of experience working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, & Lua.
### - I mostly code to make my homework easier, but I sometimes do actually cool and interesting stuff.
